      <h2>What is AI ( For People in Hurry ) - Text</h2>
      <p>
        artificial intelligence for people in a hurry the easiest way to think about 
        artificial intelligence is in the context of a human after all humans are the 
        most intelligent creatures we know off AI is a broad branch of computer science 
        the goal of AI is to create systems that can function intelligently and independently 
        humans can speak and listen to communicate through language this is the field of 
        speech recognition much of speech recognition is statistically based hence it's 
        called statistical learning humans can write and read text in a language this is the 
        field of NLP or natural language processing humans can see with their eyes and process 
        what they see this is the field of computer vision computer vision falls under the symbolic 
        way for computers to process information recently there has been another way which I'll 
        come to later humans recognize the scene around them through their eyes which create images
         of that world this field of image processing which even though is not directly related 
         to AI is required for computer vision humans can understand their environment and move 
         around fluidly this is the field of robotics humans have the ability to see patterns such 
         as grouping of like objects this is the field of pattern recognition machines are even better
          at pattern recognition because they can use more data and dimensions of data this is the 
          field of machine learning now let's talk about the human brain the human brain is a network 
          of neurons and we use these to learn things if we can replicate the structure and the function 
          of the human brain we might be able to get cognitive capabilities in machines this is the field 
          of neural networks if these networks are more complex and deeper and we use those to learn complex 
          thing that is the field of deep learning there are different types of deep learning and machines 
          which are essentially different techniques to replicate what the human brain does if we get the 
          network to scan images from left to right top to bottom it's a convolution neural network a CNN 
          is used to recognize objects in a scene this is how computer vision fits in an object recognition 
          is accomplished through AI humans can remember the past like what you had for dinner last night 
          well at least most of you we can get a neural network to remember a limited past this is a recurrent 
          neural network as you see there are two ways a eye works one is symbolic based and another is data based
           for the database side called a machine learning we need to feed the Machine lots of data before it can 
           learn for example if you had lots of data for sales versus advertising spend you can plot that data to 
           see some kind of a pattern if the machine can learn this pattern then it can make predictions based on 
           what it has learned while one or two or even three dimensions is easy for humans to understand and learn
            machines can learn in many more dimensions like even hundred or thousands that's why machines can look 
            at lots of high dimensional data and determine patterns once it learns these patterns it can make 
            predictions that humans can't even come close to we can use all these machine learning techniques to do 
            one of two things classification or prediction as an example when you use some information about customers 
            to assign new customers to a group like young adults then you are classifying that customer if you use data
             to predict if they're likely to defect to a competitor then you're making a prediction there is another way
              to think about learning algorithms used for AI if you train an algorithm with data that also contain the 
              answer then it's called supervised learning for example when you train a machine to recognize your friends
               by name you'll need to identify them for the computer if you train an algorithm with data where you want t
               he machine to figure out the patterns then it's unsupervised learning for example you might want to feed 
               the data about celestial objects in the universe and expect the machine to come up with patterns in that 
               data by itself if you give any algorithm a goal and expect the Machine through trial-and-error to achieve 
               that goal then it's called reinforcement learning a robot's attempt to climb over the wall until it succeeds
                is an example of that so there you go thanks for watching and if you like my videos please subscribe
